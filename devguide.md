# Dev Guide

## Quickref

- The entries are written in .man files which can be executed in the CL via `man ./path/to/manfile.man`
- All entries which can be accessed by this application are located in `~/.local/share/um/`.
- The 'um' application script is located in `~/.local/bin/


## Bash

### Writing a Bash Script

- Create a file <my_script>
- Implement the script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"
```
- Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x <my_script>
```

### Make the Script Accessable

Move the script to a directory that is included in the system's PATH. Commonly, custom user scripts are stored in `/usr/local/bin` or `/home/user/.local/bin`. Other directories include `/usr/bin/` and `/usr/sbin/`. You can check the PATH using `echo $PATH`.
```bash
mv <my_script> ~/.local/bin/
```

Check if you can run the script by running `<my_script>`.


### Accessing Files from the Script

1. Configuration Files
  - Location: /etc/myapp/
  - Purpose: Store configuration files that the application needs to read at runtime.
Example: /etc/myapp/config.yaml
2. Application Data (Variable Data)
  - Location: /var/lib/myapp/
  - Purpose: Store variable data files, such as databases, state files, or any other data that is generated or modified during the applicationâ€™s execution.
Example: /var/lib/myapp/data.txt
3. Logs
  - Location: /var/log/myapp/
  - Purpose: Store log files generated by the application.
Example: /var/log/myapp/app.log
4. Static Data (Read-Only Data)
  - Location: /usr/share/myapp/
  - Purpose: Store static data files that are read-only, such as documentation, icons, or default configuration files.
Example: /usr/share/myapp/defaults.txt
5. Temporary Files
  - Location: /tmp/myapp/
  - Purpose: Store temporary files that can be deleted after use.
Example: /tmp/myapp/tempfile.txt
